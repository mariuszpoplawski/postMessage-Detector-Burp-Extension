After plugin activation Burp will automatically inform us about potential postMessage risks by reporting Issues.

# Features
- Detect postMessage in each response of HTTP history
- Find multi postMessage if more then one exists in response
- Check scope and data sent (if scope is * report as vulnerability) / (in case variable is set as scope, report as potential rist for manual check)

# TODO
- Auto search for variables in target that resposne for sent data and scope (check if user cotrols the variables) (Still not implemented)
- Try to exploit potential vulnerability with local listenner (Still not implemented)
